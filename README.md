# School Manager Project

Welcome to the School Manager project! This comprehensive application is designed to streamline and manage various aspects of a school, including student enrollment, exams management, and more. It combines the power of Next.js, Spring Boot, Flask, MySQL, and machine learning for an efficient and data-driven school management system.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: This project leverages the power of Spring Boot, a popular Java framework, to create a robust and efficient backend API. It handles data processing, business logic, and interactions with the database.

- **Database**: MySQL is used as the relational database to store and manage student information, course details, attendance records, and more.

- **Frontend**: The user interface is built using Next.js, a React framework that provides server-side rendering and a great development experience. It offers a smooth and responsive user interface for managing school operations.

- **Machine Learning**: The Flask API integrates a machine learning model for predicting student grades based on relevant data. This enhances decision-making and supports personalized educational strategies.
